Topics:	
		1. import statements ( imports vs static import)
		2. Access modifiers ( public, private, default )

package Name:  day44_AccessModifiers

WarmUp: create a custom class for bankaccount

	The attributes/data that the class can have are: 
			AccountHolder, AccountName, AvailableBalance

	Actions the class can do are:
			deposit, withdraw, checking balance

	requirements:
			1. apply encapsulation
			2. user should be able to deposit, withdraw and check the balance
				2.1 if the withdrawing account is greater than available balance, 35$ penalty fee will be charger from the account

				2.2 if the available balance is less or equal to 0, account holder won't be able to withdraw money


import statements:
		import:
				import PackageName.className;
					// imports a single class from the package
						Ex: import java.util.ArrayList;

				import PackageName.*;
					// imports all the classes from the package
						Ex: import java.util.*;


		static import: used for importing the class members, we can access them directly without using class name

				import static PackageName.ClassName.StaticName;
					// imports a single static member from the class


				import static Packagename.ClassName.*;
					// imports all the static members from the class

Access Modifiers: public, protected, private, default.

		public: Open for the world, visible at everywhere.
				example: public int num = 100;

		private: Only visible within the class,	not visible outside the class.
				example: private int num = 100;

		default: Only visible to the classes in the same package, not visible outside the package.
   				 example: int num = 100;

		protected: Only visible to the classes in the same package. Not visible outside package
				   but it's inheritable outside the package, hence visible to its' child class.
				   example: protected int num = 100;


		Public is the only access modifier that's visible outside a package.
