Java Review:
        1. instance variables
        2. instance methods
        3. this keywords (this. vs this())
        4. Decimal formatter class       

    
Instance variable: created outside methods, within the class. (object)
                   it's also called fields.
Local variables: created within the methods. Not visible to other methods
                    Can only be used within the method.
                    
Instance methods: methods that does not have static specifier, but have return type. (object)

this. : used for calling instance variables, used when local and instance variables have the same names

this(): used for calling the constructors within the class

DecimalFormatter class: presented in  "java.text"

Class: where the objects are came from. it's the blueprint of the object
            determines how object will behave.
Object: instance of the class. We can store different data to objects.

Object creation:
            ClassName obj = new  ExistingConstructor;

Overload: same method name different parameter.
          return type can be same or different.
