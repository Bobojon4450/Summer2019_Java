Topic:  static keyword

package: day40_staticKeyWord

static: means that we can access the members through the Class name.
		
		Static members belongs to the class, also called class members.

What can be static in Java:
				1. static variables (class, global)
				2. static methods   (class members)
				3. static initializer block
				4. static inner class (nested class)

Instance variables: created in the class outside any method.
		            belong to the object. Each object will have its own copy.

Local variables: Declared within the methods or blocks
				 only accessible within the method or block.


Static variables: created in the class outside any method with static keyword.
		
		when a variables are static, they are shared by class and all objects of the class. 
		We can call them through the Class name.


Static methods: a method that we can call through the class name.
		
		static methods only accepts Class members (static static variables/methods)

		none static members can only be called through the objects in the static method.



Instance variable VS static variable:
		instance variables belong to object (fields)
		static variables belong to the class ( class variables)

		static methods only accepts class members, non static must be called through the object

		static features are shared by class and all other objects
				can only have one copy

		Each objects have their own copy of instance variables.


Summary:
		1. Static is shared by class and all other objects
		2. There can only be one copy for the static variable.
		3. Each objects has its own copy of instance variable.
		4. Static members can be called through the class name.
		5. Static methods only accepts static members.
		6. In order to call none static in a static method we
		   MUST call it though the object reference.

Tomorrow: initializer blocks
