Topics: For Each loop ,  Continue statement.

Warm up:
    1. write a program that can check if two Strings are build out of same 

	    Ex: 
	        if str1 = "aabbbc";  str2 ="cab";
	        output: true

	        if str1 ="abcd";  str2 ="abc";
	        output: false

	    Hint: you will need array and Arrays' methods


For each loop: 
        The for-each loop is used to access each value in a collection of values.  it's a loop that's already been iterated

			The main usage of for each is iterating over collection classes or arrays.

			for(DataType  each:  Array-Name ){


				}	

        variable name "each" represnts each values of the array

        numbers of execution of the loop depends on the length of the array

        	Ex: 
				int[] arr = {1,2,3};
				for(int each: arr){
					syso(each);  
				}
			//	each elements of the array will be printed 


when do we use for each:
        	when we don't need to create the index variables
   			 we don't provide index number in for each loop


break statement: used to exit loop and switch statement.


continue statement: used for skipping the current iteration of the loop and jumps to the next iteration.
