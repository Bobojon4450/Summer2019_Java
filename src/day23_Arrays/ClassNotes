Topic: Arrays

Warmup Task:
    1. Write a program that can devide two numbers without using division operator

    2. write a program that can find the unique characters from a String.
        Ex: 
            input:
                AAABCDEEFF
            output:
                BCD

Arrays: a variable that we can store multiple values
        regular variable:  
            int a = 10 ;  can only have one value

        Arrays:
            int[]  VariableName  =  {10, 20, 30};            
        //dataType  
    

    each values (Elements) in an array have thier own index numbers:
            int[]  VariableName = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50 }
                //index num:        0   1   2   3   4

        to retrive the data of the array:
                VariableName[indexNumber of data]:
                    VariableName[3] ==> 40
                    VariableName[0] ==> 10

  Array is immutable, and Array's size is fixed

  Array's size MUSt be initialized before use, there are two ways we can initialize Array's size:
            1. giving values:
                      int[] a ={1,2,3}
            2. giving the size only:
                int[] a = new int[LengthNumber]
